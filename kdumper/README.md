# Kernel Dumper via SceNgsInternal

Simple code to dump kernel memory using a function from the libSceNgsInternal module.

## Usage:

1) Edit the top of `main.c` to suit the firmware of the device.
2) Compile and run the executable via Visual Studio or manually, via Neighborhood.

## Library:

This exploit relies on crafting a library which uses a specific function. Details on this will be added at a later date, however these resulting files cannot be shared.
