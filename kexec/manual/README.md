# Manual

This directory contains code which can be used on 0.930.010, without the official SDK. 

In this example, an existing SELF is used as a donor for our user code. The SELF was reverse engineered to find useful functions such as `sceIo*()` and the SELF in question is referenced as app_template.self.

From here, the entrypoint of app_template was discovered and a simple, custom tool called `binsert` was made to facilitate copying our own user code into the entrypoint of app_template.

This allows us to run our own user code, without any official tools.


**build_usermode.bat** - Build payload.self from `main.c` and app_template.self.<br/>
**build_kernmode.bat** - Build kpayload.bin from `kpayload.c`.
